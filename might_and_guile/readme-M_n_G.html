  <p><strong> Version 2.3.1 </strong><br />
    <strong> Languages:</strong> English<br />
    <strong>Platforms: </strong>Windows, Mac OS X</p>
</div>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>This mod is all about improving gameplay. While I love mods that bring the game closer to PnP, like Rogue Rebalancing and aTweaks, BG is a single-player computer game. If tweaking a rule makes this specific game more fun, then it's a good tweak, PnP be damned. Consider this mod as a collection of 'house rules' specific to the BG campaign. Every choice has been made with an eye to the particular gameplay mechanics of BG2 and the EEs.</p>
  <p>I call this a "post-hac tweak mod" because it is designed to be installed on top of - not instead of - all the other great mods out there.  I began with a BGT game with over 75 mods; they made the game great, but a few things still irked me, like druid shapechanges and the the archer's called shots and awkwardly fourth-wall-breaking weapon names. (<i>Holy sword +6? Really? That's a punchline, not a game feature.</i>) I made a bunch of little tweaks, then I learned Weidu for easy re-installation, and then I learned more.  Before I knew it I had 30 components altering many different aspects of the game.</p>
  <p><strong><u>Everything is completely optional.  You can use as many or as few of the mod components as you want.  None of them rely on each other, there is no 'core' component. Use what you like, ignore what you don't.</u></strong> </p>
</div>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p><strong>Windows:</strong><br />
    The mod archive should be extracted into your game folder from the archive (or just unzipped and then copied there). If properly extracted, you should have a "might_and_guile" folder and "setup-might_and_guile.exe" in your game folder. To install, simply double-click "setup-might_and_guile.exe" and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
  <p>Run setup-might_and_guile.exe in your game folder to reinstall, uninstall or otherwise change components.</p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS X:</strong><br />
    This mod is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of the mod into your game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a folder called "might_and_guile," a file called "weidu," and the "Mac WeiDU Launcher" in your game directory. To install, simply double-click the WeiDU Launcher, choose "Might and Guile" from the list, and follow the instructions on screen.</p>
</div>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<div class="section">
  <p>Might and Guile is designed to work with any Infinity Engine game on a variant of the BG2 engine that someone might purchase and play today, in 2015. At the moment, that includes TOB, TuTu, BGT, BG:EE, BG2:EE, and IWD:EE.</p>
  <p>Might and Guile aims to be compatible with almost all other popular mods. There are however a few compatibility issues of note:<br />
  <ul>
  	<li>I have not tested compatibility with Kit Revisions. These two mods cover some of the same ground. Eventually (after KR is released, anyway) I will try to see if I can make them work well together. But for now, you should probably choose one or the other. (You may try to skip the M&G overhauls/tweaks and only install new kits... it should work, but there might be balance issues compared to the KR kits.)</li><br />
  	<li>Some of the components of <u>Rogue Rebalancing</u> modify the same resources as M&G; be aware that you might see some different behavior depending on which one is installed last.</li><br />
  </ul></p>
  <p>If you install lots of kit mods, keep in mind that without TobEx, the kit selection screen can only show 10 kits per class - the main class plus nine kits. If you install a lot of kits, some of the Might and Guile kits may not be visible. The vanilla game has 4 kits in each class, so you can install six kits without worries. Plan ahead, or else use the 'Mod Kit Remover' mod to clear space in the Character Generation screens before installing M&G.</p>
  <p><strong>Load Order:</strong><br />
    Might and Guile should be installed <strong>after</strong> all other mods that add or change items or kits. It should be installed <strong>after</strong> the "WSPATCK for All" component of <u>tb#Tweaks</u>. It should be installed <strong>before</strong> <u>Refinements</u> and <u>Sword Coast Stratagems</u>.</p>
  <p>My load order looks something like this:
  <ul>
    <li> [item mods]</li>
    <li> [quest mods]</li>
    <li> [NPC mods]</li>
    <li> [spell mods]</li>
    <li> [kit mods]</li>
    <li> [tweak mods]</li>
    <li> BG2Tweaks</li>
    <li> Might and Guile</li>
    <li> Refinements HLAs</li>
    <li> SCS</li>
    <li> aTweaks</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Contents</h2>
<div class="section">
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 220: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Movement Bonuses ("Quickstride")</em></strong></p>
      <p> Barbarians' and Monks' movement bonus is changed from a permanent characteristic to an at-will innate ability called Quickstride. Now if they want to walk more slowly to keep the group together, they can do so.</p>
      <p> Rangers and Scouts (if installed, see component 420 below) get the Quickstride ability at 10th level.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 225: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Stalkers</em></strong></p>
      <p> The Stalker loses its special wizard spells (install the Mage Hunter kit instead, see component 350 below), and can cast fewer spells per day than normal rangers. However they can set traps like a thief, and can attain greater proficiency than other rangers with daggers and short swords.</p>
      <p> ALL rangers can now backstab for x2 damage from stealth; Stalkers' backstab multiplier increases at higher levels.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 230: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Archers</em></strong></p>
    <p> Archers are switched to the Marksman schedule of bonuses and Called Shots (Trip, Disarm, Hammer Shot, and Disarm)</p> 
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; +1 to hit and damage rolls with ranged weapon at levels 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21.<br />
        &ndash; Can achieve Grand Mastery (+++++) with bows and crossbows.<br />
        &ndash; Learns the following Called Shots: 'Trip' at 2nd level; 'Disarm' at 4th level; 'Hammer Shot' at 6th level' and 'Pin' at 9th level. Called Shots may be used at will, and the effects work for one round. The Marksman has a +2 bonus to thac0 and damage while doing so, but must remain stationary during that time to set up the shot.</p>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br />
        &ndash; May only become proficient (+) with melee weapons.<br />
        &ndash; May only wear leather or similar armors.<br />.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 235: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Beastmasters</em></strong></p>
      <p> Beastmasters gain the ability to wield daggers, axes, and spears in addition to the normal group of weapons available to them.</p>
      <p> Beastmasters may shapechange into wolf and werewolf forms, and may summon a Spirit Wolf to aid them in combat once per day.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 250: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Berserker and Rage</em></strong></p>
      <p> Berserkers and Wizard Slayers are limited to Mastery (+++) in weapons. Berserkers are further limited to basic proficiency (+) in fighting styles. Berserk Rage and Barbarian Rage are merged, because 1) I don't know why there are two different kinds of Rage, and 2) vanilla Berserk Rage is more like a Mind Shield spell than an actual Rage. Rage now lasts for 30 seconds, provides a bonus 1 APR, increases STR and CON by 4, provides immunity to Charm/Hold/Stun/Confusion (but NOT level drain or Maze/Imprisonment), and penalizes AC by 2.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 260: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Kensai</em></strong></p>
      <p>At character creation, Kensai will begin with an innate spell ability that will let them choose a weapon. Upon casting, they are changed to a sub-kit which can reach Grand Mastery (+++++) in that weapon, and can only be proficient (+) in others. After gaining enough levels to master their weapon of focus and a fighting style or two, the kensai will be able to choose a second weapon of focus. Thereafter, they will be able to choose a new weapon of focus after reaching Grand Mastery in their current one.</p>
      <p>Kensai thac0/damage bonuses become just damage bonuses, because they have great thac0 anyway. Their AC bonuses get better over time like a Swashbuckler's. Finally, kensai get a 0.5 bonus to APR right from 1st level, drastically increasing their offensive capabilities. The trade-off for this is having to truly devote themselves completely and permanently to their chosen weapon: kensai <b>cannot dual-class at all.</b> If you're into playing a kensage or a kenthief, this component is not for you. But I think it allows kensai to truly shine as a kit on its own.</p>
      <p>Finally, upon choosing a weapon focus, the Kensai will receive a weapon from the Candlekeep armory. In some instances (weaker weapons like staff, spear, dagger) it will be a +1 magical weapon.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 265: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Monk Fists</em></strong></p>
      <p>Monk fists are are rebalanced to do less damage, but have higher APR.  The fists also become toggleable, able to switch at will between doing fatigue damage as a normal unenchanted fist, and crushing and magical damage as an enchanted fist.</p>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 270: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Bard Kits</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component replaces the Blade's Offensive Spin ability with a special Weapon Display "bard song" called the Blade Dance. This impressive and complicated set of weapon maneuvers causes opponents to hesitate when attacking. The Blade receives a 2-point AC bonus and nearby enemies suffer from -2 thac0 and -1 damage penalties. At levels 13 and 20 these effects increase, and opponents must save vs. spells or become Panicked.</p>
      <p>This component also improves the Skald's combat abilities, at the expense of reduced spellcasting.</p>
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>SKALD: This nordic Bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill, and virtue; <PRO_HISHER> songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skald devotes <PRO_HISHER> life to those pursuits.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; +1 bonus to hit at 1st level, and each 6 levels thereafter.<br />
        &ndash; - The Skald's Song is different from the typical Bard's and varies with level:<br />
 1st level: Grants allies a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls, and a +2 bonus to AC.<br />
 15th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear.<br />
 20th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear, stun, and confusion. <br />
</p>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br />
        &ndash; May cast one fewer spell per level compared to most bards.<br />.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h4 class="subheader">Component 275: </h4>
  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Revised Shadowdancer</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component removes Shadowdancers' "Hide in Plain Sight" ability. It also turns their "Shadowstep" ability into something called "Shadow Pool" which allows the Shadowdancer to cast any one of the following spells:<br />
        &ndash; Sanctuary<br />
        &ndash; Blur<br />
        &ndash; Blindness<br />
        &ndash; Shadow Door<br />
        &ndash; Shadowstep</p>

    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>CORSAIR: Part warrior, part rogue, part charming sailor, the Corsair is a dashing swordsman who survives by sharp wits and a sharper blade.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; Can achieve Grand Mastery (5 stars) with light bladed weapons.<br />

    <p><strong><em>Add the JONGLEUR bard kit</em></strong></p>
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>JONGLEUR: These agile bards are master acrobats and jugglers. Their skill in flipping, vaulting and balancing is matched only by their accuracy with hurled knives and other implements.</p>

        &ndash; +1 bonus to Armor Class at 1st level, plus an additional +1 bonus every 6 levels.<br />
        &ndash; May achieve Mastery (three slots) with daggers, darts, and two-weapon fighting.<br />

        &ndash; Begins with one proficiency point in Two-Weapon Style, and may add two more.<br />

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Add the GALLANT bard kit</em></strong></p>
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>GALLANT: Part charming aesthete, part dashing warrior, gallants travel the land in search of beauty, love, and adventure. They steal the hearts of the young, and lift the spirits of the elderly. Their code, similar to a paladin's, requires that they defend the innocent and members of the opposite sex, and aid the needy in times of trouble and danger.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; Gain a permanent +1 bonus to Luck.<br />
        &ndash; +1 bonus to thac0 every 6 levels.<br />
        &ndash; Essence of Purity: the Gallant clings to life with more ferocity than most, receiving +1 hit point per level for 12 levels, and receiving a +1 bonus to saves vs. death.  This saving throw bonus increases at levels 3, 6, 10, 15, and 21.<br />
        &ndash; From 7th level, may cast the priest spell Death Ward as an innate ability once per day.<br />
        &ndash; May use the innate ability "Heart of Valor" once per day, which functions like the priest spell Aid. From 9th level, this ability also Protects from Evil.</p>

  <div class="section">
   <p><strong><em>Add the LOREMASTER bard kit</em></strong></p>
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>LOREMASTER: Loremasters are romantically entranced by the past. There is a fine line between Loremaster and sage - so fine that many Lore masters call themselves sages and are rarely questioned about it. However, true sages are knowledge specialists who concentrate their efforts into mastering a specific field such as mushrooms, elven swords, and so on. Loremasters are fond of any aspect of history that makes a good story. Further, Loremasters are likely to go adventuring and exploring, playing the part of an archaeologist or anthropologist, to learn about the world first-hand instead of from dusty tomes.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; Through their devoted study of the past, gain a fundamental understanding of many strange magical items not normally usable by the bard class. Thus, they can use any magical item.<br />
        &ndash; Loremasters' studies enhance their understanding of magic, such much that they cast spells as if they were one level higher.<br />
        &ndash; Loremasters may cast the Find Traps priest spell as an innate ability.</p>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br />
        &ndash; Bard song does not improve over time.<br />.</p>

    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>MEISTERSINGER: These bards wander the woodlands, charming animals with their melodies and helping druids and rangers to protect nature. They are the enemies of ruthless hunters and trappers, striving against such activities with their animal allies, beguiling music, and nature-based magic.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; May use the ranger's Animal Empathy ability.<br />
        &ndash; May use the 'Summon Rabbit' innate ability.<br />
        &ndash; Once per day, may summon a swarm of rodents to <PRO_HISHER> aid (3 a 1st level, and 3 more for every third level after that).<br />
        &ndash; May cast the following druid spells: Cure Light Wounds, Entangle, Sanctuary, Shillelagh, Barkskin, Charm Person/Mammal, Resist Fire/Cold, Slow Poison, Remove Paralysis, Cure Disease, Zone of Sweet Air, Summon Insects, Cure Serious Wounds, Call Woodland Being, Leser Restoration, Mass Cure, Chaotic Commands, Insect Plague, Animal Summoning III, and False Dawn.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Add the LORESINGER OF MILIL divine bard kit</em></strong></p>
    <div class="kit_description">
      <p>LORESINGER OF MILIL: Loresingers venerate Milil, god of poetry, song, and storytelling. More bard than priest, they volunteer their talents as cantors for churches. Loresingers may use a mix of divine and arcane magic, but may not turn undead like most priests.</p>
      <p>Advantages:<br />
        &ndash; May cast the following priest spells: Cure Light Wounds, Sanctuary, Find Traps, Silence 15' Radius, Spiritual Hammer, Cure Medium Wounds, Holy Smite, Death Ward, Holy Power, Greater Command, Cure Critical Wounds, and False Dawn.<br />
        &ndash; The Loresinger's song gives allies the effects of the Chant spell. From 5th level it has a chance to Slow any nearby undead. From 9th level, it also grants allies Protection from Evil. And from 13th level, the song has a chance to Hold nearby undead.</p>
      <p>Disadvantages:<br />
        &ndash; Reduced pickpocketing ability.<br />.</p>

  <div class="section">
    <p><strong><em>Multiclass Kits</em></strong></p>
      <p>This component liberalizes the multiclassing rules in targeted ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Enables humans to multiclass.</li>
        <li> Enables elves to be bards, fighter/clerics, cleric/thieves, cleric/rangers, and cleric/mages.</li>
        <li> Enables half-elves to be cleric/thieves.</li>
        <li> Enables dwarves to be cleric/thieves.</li>
        <li> Enables halflings to be fighter/clerics and cleric/thieves.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>This component also makes rangers unable to dual-class to cleric, unless they first find a special totem of the goddess Mielikki and use it to change their kit to a Woodscout of Mielikki.  Multiclass ranger/clerics will automatically begin as Woodscouts, except elves who begin as Forestwalkers of Solonor Thelandira. (Note, in IWDEE and BG2EE, these ranger/cleric changes will only take effect if baldur.ini is set such that cleric/rangers receive all druid spells.)</p>
      <p>Finally, in addition to Woodscouts and Forestwalkers, this component introduces nine more multiclass kits to the game. These are not available at character generation, rather you must use a totem or item to adopt the kit. They are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li> Elven Bladesinger - for elven fighter/mages.</li>
        <li> Spellfilcher - for mage/thieves.</li>
        <li> Ranger/mage - from mage/thieves.</li>
        <li> Spellbender - for cleric/mages.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>ELVEN BLADESINGER: Among the Elven nations there is an order of warriors who wield power matched by few.  Combining martial skill with magical prowess, Bladesingers have the resources to face nearly any threat.  They master the use of long blades wielded in one hand, keeping the other free for spellcasting.</p>
        <p>Abilities:<br />
          &ndash; Bladesingers begin at level 1 with proficiency in Single-Weapon Style.  At level 7, this automatically increases to specialization.  They may reach grandmastery with long swords, scimitars, and katanas.<br />
          &ndash; Once per day per 6 levels, a bladesinger may perform the Bladesong, a dance in which <PRO_HESHE> whirls a blade faster than the eye can follow, blocking incoming attacks and devastating enemies.  Upon beginning the Bladesong, for 24 seconds, the bladesinger has a +1 bonus to thac0 per 5 levels, a -2 bonus to AC vs. melee attacks per five levels, one extra attack per round, faster movement rate, and all successful attacks do maximum damage.<br />
        <p>Restrictions:<br />
          &ndash; Bladesingers may only reach basic proficiency with other one-handed weapons and missile weapons.  They may not become proficient with two-handed weapons or in any other fighting style.<br />.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>SPELLFILCHER: The Spellfilchers are hidden society of very specialized thieves.  They hone their abilities toward a dangerous goal: stealing magic from wizards.  To that end, Spellfilchers have a few special tricks they can employ when confronted by angry mages.</p>
        <p>Abilities:<br />
          &ndash; Any target struck by a Spellfilcher in melee combat must save vs. rods/wands or suffer a 33% chance of miscast magic for 3 rounds.<br />
          &ndash; Spellfilchers may cast the priest spell "Silence 15' Radius" to prevent an enemy from casting spells.<br />
          &ndash; At 5th level, Spellfilchers may cast a special variant of "Spell Turning" which lasts for 12 hours.  It will only turn back a single spell.<br />
          &ndash; At 9th level Spellfilchers become innately and permanently protected by the effect of the spell "Non-detection."</p>
        <p>Restrictions:<br />
          &ndash; None<br />.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>RANGER/MAGE:  Yeah - ranger/mage.  (Hint, you have to start out as a thief/mage.  This component is EE-only!)</p>
        <p>Abilities:<br />
          &ndash; Bonuses to hit points and thac0 compared to thief/mages.<br />
          &ndash; Limited access to thief abilities: may only use Hide in Shadows, Move Silently, Find Traps, and Detect Illusions.<br />
          &ndash; May cast Goodberry innately, and has 3 druid spells each of levels 1-3 automatically added to the wizard spellbook.</p>
        <p>Restrictions:<br />
          &ndash; Limited to Good alignments.<br />.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="kit_description">
        <p>SPELLBENDER: Spellbenders make a science of mapping the ways to bypass Mystra's restrictions. Practicing as generalist clerics and studying arcane magery, they learn to manipulate the intersection of those two areas of magic. They may sacrifice a memorized wizard spell to instead create one of numerous divine effects; and they may sacrifice a memorized cleric spell to create an arcane effect. Some energy is lost in the translation - the improvisational effects must be spells of lower level than the one sacrificed. (It is unknown what happens to the lost energy - some believe this practice has contributed to the recent rise of wild magic and sorcerers. Spellbenders must be wary, as they are apt to be persecuted by Mystra's Monitors.)</p>
        <p>Abilities:<br />
          &ndash; Spellbenders receive the "Arcane Weaving" priest spells of levels 2-7, which allow them to cast wizard spells of one level lower.<br />
          &ndash; Spellbenders receive the "Divine Weaving" wizard spells of levels 2-7, which allow them to cast wizard spells of one level lower.<br />.</p>
