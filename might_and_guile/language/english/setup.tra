But those who put their faith in the Forest Queen by this means will be able to become a Woodscout, a secialized priest of Mielikki.

Woodscouts combine the abilities of rangers and clerics.  It is said that Mielikki has received a special dispensation from Silvanus to grant her Woodscouts access to powerful druidic magic, so that they might better protect nature and champion the cause of justice.

Combining martial skill with magical prowess, Bladesingers have the resources to face nearly any threat.  They master the use of long blades wielded in one hand, keeping the other free for spellcasting.

Bladesingers begin at level 1 with proficiency in Single-Weapon Style.  At level 7, this automatically increases to specialization.  They may reach grandmastery with long swords, scimitars, and katanas, and may only reach basic proficiency with other one-handed weapons and missile weapons.  They may not become proficient with two-handed weapons or in any other fighting style.

Once per day per 6 levels, a bladesinger may perform the Bladesong, a dance in which a blade is spun and whirled faster than the eye can follow, blocking incoming attacks and devastating enemies.  Upon beginning the Bladesong, for 24 seconds, the bladesinger has a +1 bonus to thac0 per 5 levels, a -2 bonus to AC vs. melee attacks per five levels, one extra attack per round, faster movement rate, and all successful attacks do maximum damage.

First, they may cast the priest spell "Silence 15' Radius" to prevent an enemy from casting spells. Of course many wizards know the Vocalize spell to overcome such a disadvantage, but a skilled Spellfilcher knows that the time it takes to do so may make all the difference in the world.

Second, at 5th level Spellfilchers can cast a special variant of "Spell Turning" which lasts for 12 hours.  It will only turn back a single spell, but doing so may give a Spellfilcher the time he or she needs to get better spell protections up if surprised.  Spellfilchers commonly erect this protection every morning, before even brushing their teeth.

Third, at 9th level Spellfilchers become innately and permanently protected by the effect of the spell "Non-detection," enabling them to use their thiefly abilities to hide even from wizards with powerful scrying magic.

Finally, every time a Spellfilcher successfully strikes a wizard with a melee attack, the target must save vs. rods/wands or suffer a 33% chance of miscast magic for 2 rounds.

Mask grants his Nightrunners a few special abilities to advance his cause.

The secrets contained in this tome may enable the owner to learn the skills and abilities of a Spellbender.

@6000   = ~600: Wizard Class Changes~
@6002   = ~MAGE: The wizard strives to be a master of magical energies, shaping them and casting them as spells. To do so, wizards study strange tongues and obscure facts and devotes much time to magical research. Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards. The Mage studies all types of magic and learns a wide variety of spells; this breadth of focus makes mages well suited to the demands of adventuring.

CLASS FEATURES:

 - May not wear any armor.
 - May use and become proficient (+) with the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling.
 - May not place any slots in any fighting style.
 - May cast arcane spells.
 - May cast cantrips, which are weak magical spells that may be cast repeatedly, at will. (Each school of magic has one cantrip associated with it.)
 - Trueclass (unkitted) mages may choose any one of the eight available cantrips.
 
Hit Die: d4

Prime Requisite For Dual-Classing: Intelligence~
@6003   = ~ABJURER: A Mage who specializes in protective magic and metamagic disciplines. These mages can erect powerful wards and barriers, and are also trained to break those wards and effects that are created by other spellcasters.

Advantages:
- Abjurers automatically learn spells from the school of Abjuration.
- Abjurers may use the "Protective Shell" cantrip, which lasts for 3 turns and harmlessly absorbs the first physical strike that hits the caster.
- Abjurers gain the Parry Magic and Spell Thrust abilities earlier than other mages.
- When Abjurers cast spell protections, such as a Globe of Invulnerability or Spell Deflection, a Spell Shield is automatically created at the same time, giving the Abjurer an extra layer of protection.~
@6004   = ~CONJURER: A Mage who specializes in creating or summoning creatures and objects, moving them through space. These wizards ultimately master teleportation magic, able to banish enemies and summon aid from different planes altogether.

Advantages:
- Conjurers automatically learn spells from the school of Conjuration.
- Conjurers may use the "Conjure Rabbit" cantrip, which conjures a rabbit out of thin air!
- Conjurers may cast Monster Summoning I innately at 2rd and 4th levels; Monster Summoning II at 6th and 8th levels; and Monster Summoning III at 10th level.~
@6005   = ~CONJURER: A Mage who specializes in creating or summoning creatures and objects, moving them through space. These wizards ultimately master teleportation magic, able to banish enemies and summon aid from different planes altogether.

@6006   = ~DIVINER: A Mage who specializes in detection and divining magics.

Advantages:
- Diviners automatically learn spells from the school of Divination.
- Diviners do not take extra damage from thieves' backstabs.
- Diviners can use the Contingency ability at level 1, and can load it with two spells from level 10.~
@6007   = ~ENCHANTER: A Mage who specializes in Charm and Enchantment magic. These wizards are adept both at using magic to influence the minds of others, inducing sleep, friendliness, despair, or dementia.

Advantages:
- Enchanters automatically learn spells from the school of Enchantment.
- Enchanters may use the "Drowse" cantrip, which causes a target to briefly fall asleep if the target fails a saving throw.
- Enchanters are resistant to magic within their specialty, becoming immune to Charm and Sleep spells.
- Magical effects are harder to resist near an Enchanter: nearby enemies automatically suffer a -2 penalty to saves vs. spells.~
@6008   = ~ILLUSIONIST: A Mage who specializes in creating illusions to confuse and mislead. These canny wizards can bend light and manipulate perceptions in various ways. They can duck out of sight when in danger, and eventually gain the power to create illusions of startling substance and realism.

Advantages:
- Illusionists automatically learn spells from the school of Illusion.
- Illusionists may use the "Bedazzle" cantrip, which dazzles the target's eyes and causes -1 penalties to thac0, damage, and AC for 12 seconds (increasing to -3 penalties, and suffering from Blindness for 6 seconds, if the target fails a saving throw vs. spells).

- Invokers may use the "Magic Bolt" cantrip, which does 1d4+1 hit points of magic damage to the target.
- Invokers do 20% more damage with spells that involve fire, lightning, cold, or magic damage.~
@6010   = ~NECROMANCER: A Mage who specializes in magic dealing with death, undeath, and energy from the Negative Material Plane. Necromancy is a disturbing art, reviled by most civilized practitioners and academies of magic. They experiment with the living and the dead, and create undead abominations that straddle the gap in between. With practice, some Necromancers eventually learn techniques to achieve immortality by changing their own bodies into the form of a lich.

Advantages:
- Necromancers are the only wizards able to cast spells from the school of Necromancy.
- Necromancers automatically learn spells from the school of Necromancy.
- Necromancers may use the "Stiffen Bones" cantrip, causes -1 penalties to thac0 and AC for 12 seconds (increasing to -2 penalties and being Slowed if the target fails a saving throw).
- Necromancers may transform parts of their bodies with the power of energy from the Negative Material Plane. Once they learn the technique from a scroll, they may innately use the power of a Chilling Touch, Ghoul Touch, or Vampiric Touch.~
@6011   = ~TRANSMUTER: A Mage who specializes in magic that alters physical reality. These wizards control and transform matter in all the ways their magical learning affords them. They can cause the air to turn to a toxic mist, change their own shape into that of a powerful monster, and even stop time itself. Transmuters are also alchemists, creating the various magical potions on which so many adventurers rely.

Advantages:
- Transmuters automatically learn spells from the school of Alteration.
- Transmuters may use the "Earthen Grasp" cantrip, which causes tendrils from the ground to reach out and Entangle the target for 1 round (and Holding the target frozen in place for that time if the target fails a saving throw).
- Transmuters can maintain the stability of their personal form, resisting hostile polymorph, petrification, and disintegration effects.
- Beginning at 11th level, Transmuters may learn to animate a golem for short periods of time. Golems generally cannot be created on short notice; the effort involved is such that it will only be in existence for 60 seconds, and the Transmuter becomes fatigued and suffers a 1-second penalty to casting speed until the next rest period. A flesh golem may be animated at first; this upgrades to a clay golem at 14th level, and a stone golem at 18th level, and a juggernaut golem at 24th level.~

Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed, making the caster recall a previously cast spell.

It excludes area effects that are not centered directly upon the wizard. As long as the spell is cast directly at the wizard, it will be reflected back upon the caster. This spell will only affect up to 4th-level spells, but as long as there are levels remaining, a spell will be absorbed. For example, if there is only 1 level left and a 3rd-level spell is cast at the wizard, the spell will be absorbed and will exhaust the protection.

This spell will absorb and protect against a total of 5 spell levels of magic directed at the caster. It will not protect the caster from Dispel Magic, but will not be dispelled by Dispel Magic either.~

Saving Throw: None 

This spell creates an incredibly powerful barrier of magical protection around the spellcaster. Every spell that hits the barrier is absorbed by the power of the spell trap—making the caster recall a previously cast spell. For example, if a wizard is protected by Spell Trap and is then hit by a Flame Arrow (3rd-level spell), the wizard will get three spell levels back—e.g. one spell up to 3rd level in power. 

The Spell Trap is remarkably stable, remaining in place for 4 hours unless dispelled or exhausted. It provides 30 levels of protection (i.e., ten Flame Arrows or five Fingers of Death). The spell trap can absorb any level of spell, from one to nine.~

Use of the Magic Missile spell, one of the most popular first level spells, creates up to four missiles of magical energy that dart forth from the wizard's fingertip and unerringly strike their target, which must be a creature of some sort. Each missile inflicts 1d4+1 points of damage. The spell fires two missiles at 1st level, three at 5th level, and a maximum of four at 9th level.~
@6098   = ~Sorcerer~
@6099   = ~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

@6111  = ~Grease
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Special

A Grease spell causes the surface of the ground to take on a slippery, greasy nature. Any creature entering the area or caught in it when the spell is cast must save vs. Spell at +2 or slip and slide, unable to move effectively. Those who successfully save can move, albeit slowly, for the rest of the round (but will need to save vs. Spell again the following round). Those who remain in the area are allowed a Saving Throw each round until they escape the area.~
@6112  = ~Protection From Evil
(Divination)

Level: 2
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~
@6113  = ~Mirror Image (Illusion/Phantasm) 
Level: 3
Range: 0 
Duration: 3 rounds + 1 round/level 
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

When a mirror image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes from two to eight exact duplicates of himself to come into being around him. These images do exactly what the wizard does. Since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, but any other existing images remain intact until they are struck.  However, it is important to note that this will not protect the caster against every attack as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images.~
@6114  = ~Glitterdust
(Illusion)

Level: 2
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 30 ft.
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. This spell showers glittering golden particles in the area of effect. Enemies must roll a successful Saving Throw vs. Spell or be blinded (-4 penalty to attack rolls and Armor Class) for 4 rounds. In addition, all enemies who fail their Saving Throw are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades, thus revealing invisible creatures. The dust fades in 4 rounds.~
@6115  = ~Luck
(Divination)

Level: 1
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The recipient of this gains a very slight, instinctive insight into the immediate future. The result is that the subject appears to be lucky in every regard for the next 3 rounds, receiving a 5% bonus to all actions. This includes Saving Throws, to-hit rolls, damage, thieving skills, etc.~
@6116  = ~Flame Arrow
(Alteration)

Level: 3
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts, superheats them, and then hurls fiery bolts at opponents at very high speed. Each bolt inflicts 1d6 points of piercing damage plus 4d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. Spell. The caster receives one bolt every 5 levels beyond the 5th (2 bolts at 10th level, 3 at 15th level, etc.). All of the bolts will streak toward the target of the spell.~
@6117  = ~Greater Malison
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 4
Range: 50 ft.
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

The spell grants the caster the ability to understand and subtly manipulate the flow of time, making any following spells more likely to be successful and effective. The practical result is to adversely affect all enemy Saving Throws. The effect is applied to all hostile creatures within the area of effect, who make all saving throws at a penalty of -4.~
@6118  = ~Shadow Stalker
(Illusion/Phamtasm)

Level: 6
Range: 120 ft.
Duration: 9 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a double of the caster formed from pure shadow, and imparts upon it some degree of form and autonomy. Blurry and shapeless, this entity will fight on the caster's behalf and remain in relatively stable form for up to 9 hours (unless it meets a violent demise).~
@6119  = ~Mordenkainen's Sword
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 7
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. The sword will float in the air completely under the caster's control. (This does not prevent the caster from doing any other actions during the spell's duration.) The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and deals 5d4 points of damage upon hitting a target.~
@6120  = ~Abi-Dalzim's Horrid Wilting
(Necromancy) 

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

This spell creates violent whorls of magical energy within the area of effect which do grievous harm to all enemies, inflicting 1d8 damage per level of the caster. Affected creatures are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell for half damage. This spell is especially devastating to water elementals and plant creatures, who receive a penalty of -2 to their Saving Throws.~
@6121  = ~Black Blade of Disaster
(Enchantment/Charm) 

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 18 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None 

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster becomes a Grand Master in the use of the weapon. It acts as a +5 weapon and deals 2-24 damage to its victims. Every time it hits a target, the victim must make a Save vs. Death at +4 or be disintegrated. There is also a 10% chance with every hit that the sword drains 4 levels from the target and heals the wielder 20 Hit Points.~
@6122  = ~Weird
(Illusion/Phantasm) 

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster 
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 30-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates phantasmal visions of unimaginable horror in the mind of all enemies in the area of effect. The spell is risky because such intense and unreal illusions may be disbelieved (subjects may avoid the effects if they make a saving throw vs. death). But affected creatures who fail their save are so drastically affected that they die instantly.~
@6123  = ~Wizard Eye
(Necromancy)

Level: 4
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the result of a Necromancer dipping his toes into the Diviner's sphere of influence. With it, an actual eyeball is enchanted to float around and send visual information to the caster's mind. The Wizard Eye can see with normal vision up to 60 ft. away in brightly lit areas, and can travel in any direction as long as the spell lasts. Solid barriers prevent the passage of a Wizard Eye. The powers of the eye cannot be enhanced by other spells or items. The caster is subject to any gaze attack met by the eye. A successful Dispel Magic spell cast on the wizard or the eye ends the spell.~
@6124   = ~Discorporate~
@6125   = ~Discorporate
(Necromancy)

Level: 6
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole.  The target creature must make a Saving Throw vs. Spell or burst into a million small particles, resembling dust. This effect is instantaneous and irreversible.~
@6126   = ~Energy Drain~
@6127   = ~Energy Drain
(Necromancy) 

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None 

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  This has the  practical effect of draining the victim of 4 levels of experience. The target loses levels, Hit Dice, Hit Points, and abilities permanently - they can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  There is no saving throw to resist the effect.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~
@6128  = ~Protection From Evil
Level: 2
School: Divination
Range: Touch
Duration: 2 rounds/level
Casting Time: 1

Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, it gives the protected creature a magical insight into the minds of any nearby creatures with evil intent. The slight foreknowledge that results causes all attacks made by evil or evilly enchanted creatures to receive a penalty of -2 to each attack roll. Summoned demons and fiends are acutely affected by this spell; evil is woven into their very beings. Therefore, they are completely unable to target the protected creature.~
@6129  = ~Glitterdust
Level: 2
School: Illusion
Range: Medium
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 10' radius
Saving Throw: Special

This spell was created by an Invoker wizard who was convinced that he was being stalked by assassins with the ability to become invisible. Unfortunately, he had no skill with Divination spells. It sprays a cloud of glittering golden particles within the area of effect. The sparkling dust dazzles all opponents in the area (-2 penalty to attack rolls) for 4 rounds and reveals any opponents who are invisible. Those affected must also save vs. breath to avoid becoming completely covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle for 4 rounds. Those failing the save remain unable to successfully hide themselves until the dust fades.~
@6130  = ~Mirror Image
Level: 3
School: Illusion
Range: Personal
Duration: 5 turns
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: Caster
Saving Throw: None

When a Mirror Image spell is invoked, the spellcaster causes a number of illusory duplicates of himself to come into being around him. The spell creates two images plus one for every 3 levels of the caster (up to a maximum of eight images at 18th level). These images do exactly what the wizard does, and since the spell causes a blurring and slight distortion when it is cast, it is impossible for opponents to be certain which are the illusions and which is the actual wizard. When an image is directly struck by a melee or missile attack, magical or otherwise, it disappears, while other existing images remain intact. It is important to note that this will not protect the caster against all attacks, as it is possible for an enemy to choose the real caster amongst all the images. This spell cannot be cast on anyone who is under the effects of a Reflected Image spell, and casting the spell multiple times will not multiply the number of images created.~

@6132  = ~Flame Arrow
Level: 3
School: Alteration
Range: Long
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: Breath half

This spell begins with one or more common arrows or bolts (one for every two experience levels, up to a maximum of five arrows at level 10), superheats them, and then hurls them at opponents at very high speed. Each arrow inflicts 1d6 points of missile damage plus 2d6 points of fire damage. Only half of the fire damage is inflicted if the creature struck saves vs. breath at -2. Upon completion of the spell, the first arrow will streak towards the creature targeted by the wizard, while additional arrows will randomly target opponents within range.~

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

When this spell is cast at another being, a greenish burst of negative energy shoots toward the target, disrupting the very energy that keeps the target whole. Upon contact, the target must make a saving throw vs. breath at -2 or suffer 2d6 points of magic damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). A creature that makes a successful save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as a Mordenkainen's Sword, which is automatically destroyed when struck. This spell has no affect on clothing or equipment carried by the target.~
@6137  = ~Mordenkainen's Sword
Level: 7
School: Enchantment
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting this spell, the wizard temporarily imbues a normal blade with magical power and a will of its own. Once the spell is cast, the sword will float in the air completely under the control of the caster, until the spell duration expires or the sword is dispelled. The sword acts as a +4 weapon in all respects and attacks on its own once each round, inflicting 5d4 damage when it hits a target. It has 100% resistance to almost all forms of damage (acid, cold, fire, electricity, poison, etc.), and 95% resistance to physical damage, but it is vulnerable to pure magic damage. The sword is immune to mind affecting spells, has 36 hit points, AC 5, and THAC0 2. Note that this spell does not prevent the caster from performing any other actions while the spell is in effect.~

This spell imposes a black, magical planar rift over the blade of a normal weapon. The caster wields the blade as if proficient with the weapon, and brandishes it with a base THAC0 of 0. The sword deals 2d12 damage per strike, and acts as a +5 magical weapon in all regards, including hit and damage bonuses. With each hit, there is a 15% chance the victim must make a save vs. spell at -2 or be disintegrated (40d6 points of magic damage, 5d6 on a successful save).~

The casting of this spell opens a channel between the caster's plane and the Negative Energy Plane. The caster of the spell acts as a conduit between the two planes, sucking life energy from a victim and transferring it to the Negative Energy Plane.  The practical effect is to drain the victim 4 levels of experience - levels, Hit Dice, hit points, and abilities are lost permanently.  These can only be restored by a priest's Restoration spell.  As the life force passes through the caster, it temporarily invigorates him, granting him an additional 20 hit points, a +4 bonus to attack rolls and saving throws, and +20% bonus to every skill.  These effects last for 1 hour.  The target's magic resistance, if any, does not affect this spell, and there is no saving throw to avoid the Drain.  What's more, the shock of the effect is so great that if the victim fails a saving throw with a -2 penalty, he or she dies instantly.~

The touched creature suffers 1d4+1 points of cold damage and must save vs. Death or be Slowed and lose three points of Strength for two rounds. 

Undead touched by this energy are Held for two rounds. They do not receive a savign throw to avoid the effect.~
@6253   = ~Ghoul Touch~
@6254   = ~Ghoul Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, a red glow encompasses his hand. On a successful touch, the spell inflicts 1d4+1 points of magic damage. If the victim fails a saving throw vs. death, the spell continues to do 1d4 damage in the second round and 1d3 damage in the third round. Furthermore, the victim is paralyzed for 1 round and infected with a disease that saps his Strength, Dexterity and Constitution by two points each for five rounds.~
@6255   = ~Vampiric Touch~
@6256   = ~Vampiric Touch

When a necromancer uses this ability, his hand is encompassed by a pale blue fire. Anyone successfully attacked by the necromancer loses 1d6+1 hit points, while the necromancer gains 1d6+1 hit points (any hit points over the caster's normal maximum treated as temporary additional hit points, lasting for 4 turns). Upon failing a saving throw vs. death with a -2 penalty, the victim loses 1d6 more hit points and also suffers a loss of 3 points of Constitution for one turn. 

Any undead touch by the necromancer while this ability is active are placed under the necromancer's control for five rounds.~

With this spell, the wizard drains the life force from a target and adds it to his own. The target creature suffers 1d4+1 points of damage, while the mage gains 1d4+1 hit points. For every three levels of the caster, the draining repeats one round later. The maximum duration of five rounds is reached by 12-level necromancers.

If the mage goes over his maximum hit point total with this spell, he loses it after 1 turn.~

Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: vs. Death

By means of a Ray of Enfeeblement, a wizard launches a magical attack against the vitality of an opponent, reducing its Strength and thereby the attacks that rely upon it. The victim's Strength score is automatically reduced by 4 points for the duration of the spell. Additionally, if the target fails a saving throw vs. Death, the Strength penalty is doubled to -8, and the victim suffers the effects of a Slow spell (half movement rate and -4 penalties to thac0 and AC). These effects last for 1 turn.~
@6351   = ~Contingency~
@6352   = ~Contingency
Upon using this ability, the wizard is allowed to choose a spell from his repertoire of known spells. One spell level every 3 levels of the caster is allowed (rounded up), up to 7th-level spells at 19th level. Once the spell is chosen, the caster can choose a condition of some kind from the list provided. The starting condition can be anything from reaching 10% of <PRO_HISHER> Hit Points to an enemy being sighted. Once this starting condition is satisfied, the spell that was chosen will be cast automatically.

For example, a 12th-level wizard could place the spell Stoneskin in a Contingency with the starting condition being "the wizard reaches 50% of his Hit Points." Once the wizard is reduced to 50% max Hit Points or below, Stoneskin would be immediately cast. This requires no action by the wizard, but happens automatically and instantaneously.~
